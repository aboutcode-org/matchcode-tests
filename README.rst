- In the clone, run ``make dev``
- run ``. venv/bin/activate``
- run the full test suite with::

    pytest -vvs tests

This is designed to run only on Linux.


Tests
=====

``test_matchcode.py`` uses the dataset "Analyzing the Dependability of Large
Language Models for Code Clone Generation"
(https://zenodo.org/records/11398703). This dataset contains code solutions to
problems from LeetCode that have been generated by AI from an original solution.
The tests in ``test_matchcode.py`` compare the original solutions to the
different variations of AI generated solutions, where we compare Hamming
distances and detected ngrams from the different solutions.
